learning how to create a new file...



Try to rename a folder, but the book says that we can not rename one.
But actually it works???  (not exactly!!!
I just change the folder's name "document" to "new_docs", but I found that the "document" was gone.
Which is probably because when I create "document", I didn't put a .gitkeep file into it, so the "document" wasn't an actual folder!!!
